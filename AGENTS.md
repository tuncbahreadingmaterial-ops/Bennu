# Product direction

- Bennu is a data-oriented programming language written in C++.
- Use [Anka](https://github.com/tuncb/anka) for language-design cues and experiments. Anka is inspiration, not a requirement for architectural or behavioral compatibility; document where Bennu deliberately differs.
- Optimize first for correctness, data integrity, a small coherent language, predictable costs, and measurable performance.

# C++ and architecture constraints

- Do not use object-oriented design.
- Keep data and behavior separate: represent data with plain structs and transform it with free functions.
- Do not add `private` or `protected` members. Structs expose their data directly.
- Do not add operator overloads.
- Do not add default function arguments.
- Do not use C++ exceptions for normal or recoverable errors. Do not throw exceptions from Bennu-owned code.
- Return errors explicitly. `tl::optional` and `tl::expected` may be used when optional- or expected-style results are appropriate.
- Prefer direct data flow, contiguous and simple data layouts, visible ownership and allocation, and shallow abstractions. Complexity must buy a concrete language or product capability.
